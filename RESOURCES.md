# Resources

More general resources on the movement to redecentralise the internet. (Also called the Indie Web movement). If it's not a link to a specific project, it belongs here.

## Techniques and ideas

* A proposal for [protection against identity theft](http://codeforcode.com/blog/2013/9/21/how-to-do-online-accounts-better) that works by decentralizing the storage of personal information. Using such a strategy would make websites less enticing targets for hackers and would allow users to be in control of where and how their personal information is stored.

## Online articles

Articles and blog posts.

* [Meet the Hackers Who Want to Jailbreak the Internet](http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/08/indie-web/) - an article on wired.com about the Indie Web.

## Web Communities
